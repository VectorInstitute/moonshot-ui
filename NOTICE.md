no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and

  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    You changed the files; and

  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
(language-subtag-registry 0.3.22, type-fest 0.20.2, type-fest 2.19.0)

Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal
==================================


Creative Commons Legal Code
---------------------------


CC0 1.0 Universal
-----------------

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;

  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
    Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not

  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work or

  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
    other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
    use of the Work.

GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
(axe-core 4.7.0, next 14.2.3)

GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
=================================

Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.


Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the
community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions
of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two
steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which
gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in
alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become
available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software
are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case
of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU
General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public
access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.

The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in
such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It
requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the
modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use
of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access
to the source code of the modified version.

An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by
Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license,
not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the
Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each
licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals
or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work
"based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to the extent
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays
an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material
for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered
works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted
material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention
of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by
exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you
disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in
any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
    giving a relevant date.

  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
    modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
    such permission if you have separately received it.

  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not
    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which
are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its
resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code
    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in
    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
    needed to satisfy these requirements.

  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified
versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its
Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically
for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in
which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the
recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object
code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that
are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you
to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed
    by works containing it; or

  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
    different from the original version; or

  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
    of the material; or

  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
    trademarks, or service marks; or

  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions"
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part
of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a
term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of
this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to
receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization,
or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity
transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the
predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,
royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and
you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express agreement or
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
To "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network
server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of
the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a
country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe
are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them
to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of
one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you
under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program.

13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program,
your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it
remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction)
an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing
access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through
some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This
Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered
by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to
the following paragraph.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link
or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by
version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU
Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of
acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,
no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you
should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For
example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a

could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different
programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. For more

Version 2, June 1991
--------------------

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms
    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such
    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program
    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included
    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
    "you".

    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered
    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program
    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its
    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been
    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
    Program does.

  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
    also meet all of these conditions:

      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
        that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
        in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to
        be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms
        of this License.

      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a
        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive
        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the
        Program is not required to print an announcement.)

    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
    the Program.

    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
    License.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections
        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only
        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
        Subsection b above.)

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
    component itself accompanies the executable.

    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
    object code.

  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of
    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties to this License.

  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
    Program.

    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
    cannot impose that choice.

    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
    consequence of the rest of this License.

  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
    body of this License.

  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
    problems or concerns.

    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

    NO WARRANTY

  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR
    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called
something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
of this License.

      the version number 2.1.]


Preamble
--------

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed
that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original
version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by
problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this
license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary
General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore
permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.
The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other
code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General
Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.
To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more
frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to
free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
---------------------------------------------------------------

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying
it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer
of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
      that you changed the files and the date of any change.

      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
      third parties under the terms of this License.

      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of
      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose
      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used
      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,
      the square root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be
      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then
      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose
      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to
      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise
      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
      based on the Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with
      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of
      this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a
newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any
other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part
of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the
Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing
that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with
the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must
supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as
well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you
must do one of these things:

      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the
      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete
      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a
      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that
      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will
      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
      definitions.)

      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a
      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the
      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
      made with.

      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for
      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
      materials from the same place.

      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
      that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of
      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept
this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work
based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library
or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on
you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is
up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a
version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
----------------------------------------------

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public
License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

      Copyright (C) year name of author

      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public

      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either

      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU

      Lesser General Public License for more details.

      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public

      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software

      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a
sample; alter the names:

      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in

      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

      by James Random Hacker.

      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

      Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement
(next 14.2.3, picomatch 2.3.1)

The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement
==========================================================

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document. You may use content from this license document as source material for
your own license agreement, but you may not use the name "Hacktivismo
Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement ," ("HESSLA") or any confusingly
similar name, trademark or service-mark, in connection with any license agreement
that is not either (1) a verbatim copy of this License Agreement, or (2) a
license agreement that contains only additional terms expressly permitted by The
HESSLA.

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT

Software that Hacktivismo[fn1] releases under this License Agreement is intended
to promote our political objectives. And, likewise, the purpose of this License
Agreement itself is political: Namely, to compliment the software's intended
political function. Hacktivismo itself exists to develop and deploy computer
software technologies that promote fundamental human rights of end-users.
Hacktivismo also seeks to enlist the active participation and involvement of
people around the world, to help us improve these software tools, and to take
other actions (including actions that involve using and distributing our
software, and the advancement of similarly-minded software projects of others)
that promote human rights and freedom worldwide.

  [fn1] http://hacktivismo.com/

Because of our non-commercial objective of promoting end-users' freedoms,
Hacktivismo has some special, and admittedly ambitious, licensing needs. This
License Agreement enhances the benefits of published source code by backing up
our human rights projects with appropriate remedies enforceable in court.

The Freedoms We Promote: When we speak of the freedom of end-users, we are
talking about basic freedoms recognized in the Hacktivismo Declaration,[fn2] the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,[fn3] the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,[fn4] and other documents that recognize and promote
freedom and human dignity. Principal among these freedoms are:

  [fn2] http://hacktivismo.com/about/declarations/
  [fn3] http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm
  [fn4] http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html

Freedom of Expression: The freedom of opinion and expression "include[s] freedom
to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of
frontiers,"[fn5] and the freedom to choose one's own medium of expression. The
arbitrary use of technological censorship measures to block or prevent access to
broad categories of speech and expression including the work of critics,
intellectuals, artists, journalists, and religious figures is seldom, if ever,
justified by any legitimate governmental objective. And, to the extent that
technology enables censorship decisions to be removed from public scrutiny and
review, technology-based censorship mechanisms are especially suspect and
dangerous to civil society. When repressive governments and other institutions of
power seek to deprive people of this basic freedom, people have the right to
secure, employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which
they are justifiably entitled.

  [fn5] Article 19, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Freedom of Collective Action and Association: People have and should have the
"freedom of peaceful assembly and association."[fn6] This freedom includes the
right of people to work together to secure constructive change in their personal,
economic, and political circumstances. When repressive governments or other
institutions of power seek to deprive people (including users of the Internet) of
their freedoms of voluntary assembly, association, and common enterprise, people
have the right to secure, employ and deploy technologies that reclaim the
freedoms to which they are justifiably entitled.

  [fn6] Article 20(1), Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Freedoms of Thought, Conscience, Sexuality, and Religion: People have and should
have the freedom of "thought, conscience, and religion."[fn7] This right
"includes freedom to change religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in
community with others, in public or private, to manifest any religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observance, regardless of doctrine."[fn8]
Every person, regardless of sex or sexual preference, and with reciprocal respect
for the corresponding rights of all others, has and should have the right to
determine and choose, freely and without coercion, whether, how and with whom he
or she shall fully enjoy the most private and personal aspects of human life,
including individual sexuality, reproduction, and fertility. Moreover, "[t]he
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women to control all
aspects of their health, in particular their own fertility, is basic to their
empowerment."[fn9] When repressive governments and other institutions of power
seek to deprive people of these basic freedoms, they have the right to secure,
employ and deploy the tools necessary to reclaim the freedoms to which they are
justifiably entitled.

  [fn7] Article 18, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
  [fn8] Id.
  [fn9] Paragraph 17, Beijing Declaration of the Fourth United Nations Conference
  on Women (Sept. 15, 1995).

Freedom of Privacy: Every person has the right to be free from "subject[ion] to
arbitrary interference with his [or her] privacy, family, home or
correspondence"[fn10] -- digitally, or by any other means or methodology. This
freedom of privacy includes the right to be free from governmental or private
surveillance that might interfere with or deter the rightful exercise of any
other freedoms of any person. In the context of software tools that enable people
to reclaim their freedoms, all end-users have and should have the right to secure
and use tools that are free from the surreptitious insertion into their software
of "backdoors," "spy-ware," escrow mechanisms, or other code or techniques that
might promote surveillance, or subvert security (including cryptographic
security), confidentiality, anonymity, authenticity and/or trust.

  [fn10] Article 12, Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Reasons For Enhancing "Free" and "Open-Source" Licensing: Developing a new
software license is never a trivial task and this License Agreement has presented
special challenges for Hacktivismo. Because of our human rights objectives, this
License Agreement includes some specific terms and conditions that, as a
technical matter, depart from the previously-recognized and established
definitions of "free"[fn11] software and "open source"[fn12] software.

  [fn11] http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
  [fn12] http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.php

We have therefore coined the term "enhanced source" to describe this License
Agreement because we have sought to combine most of the freedom-promoting
benefits of "free" or "open-source" software (including mandatory disclosure of
any changes or modifications Licensees make to the source code, whenever they
release modified versions of HESSLA-licensed Programs or other Derivative Works),
with additional enhanced license and contractual terms that are intended to
promote the freedom of end-users. The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software
License Agreement promotes our objectives in an enhanced manner by including
contractual terms that empower both Hacktivismo and qualified end-users with
greater flexibility and leverage to maintain and recover human rights, through
the mechanism of the contract itself including terms that are designed to enhance
both our enforcement posture and that of qualified end-users in court.

To be sure, Hacktivismo enthusiastically endorses and supports the goals and
objectives of the Free Software movement and those of the open source community.
In particular, we owe a special debt of gratitude to the Free Software
Foundation, to the Open Source Initiative, and to many exceedingly talented
people who have contributed to Free Software and open source projects and
endeavors over the years.

Ultimately, however, after reviewing the field of possibilities among
previously-existing "open source" and "free" licenses, Hacktivismo has concluded
that none of them fully meets our requirements. Writing our own License Agreement
enables us to pursue our human rights objectives more effectively. This licensing
endeavor represents a first step toward achieving our objectives, and no doubt
informed feedback, scholarship, and learned commentary will enable us to pursue
our objectives even more effectively in the future.

Benefits That Carry Over From Free Software: Before we explain how an "enhanced
source" License Agreement specifically differs from a "free" or "open source"
license, we believe it is helpful to explain in greater detail what the principal
advantages, and freedom-enhancing aspects, of "free" software are.

When we speak of "free software," we refer to important personal freedoms, and
not price. In addition to terms that are intended to promote the freedoms of
Expression, Thought, Collective Action and Privacy (along with other human
rights) of all end-users, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License
Agreement is also designed and intended to promote the following freedoms:

  * You have the freedom to distribute copies of the software (and charge for
    this service if You wish);

  * You have the freedom of access to the source code, to inspect and verify (and
    even to improve, if You can) the integrity and functionality of the software;

  * So long as You do not subvert or infringe the freedoms of end-users by doing
    so, You have the freedom to change the software or to use parts of it in new
    Programs;

  * You have the freedom to know You can do these things.

The licenses for most computer software programs are designed to take away Your
freedom to share software or change source code. This kind of software is
designated as proprietary or "closed." The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software
License Agreement -- like other license agreements that have served as
inspiration for our work -- is intended to promote both Your freedom to share our
software with others, and Your freedom to change and improve the software. Your
right under this License Agreement to look at the source not only enables You to
contribute Your own efforts to Hacktivismo's human rights projects, but also
serves as an additional level of assurance to You as an end-user that unwelcome,
hidden surprises have not been inserted into the software, that could compromise
Your rights and freedoms when You use the software.

HESSLA Helps Safeguard Additional End-User Freedoms: In order to understand why
this License Agreement must be described as "enhanced source," and cannot
strictly speaking be considered either a "free" or "open source" license
agreement, it is helpful to consider the possibility that a programmer might
insert malicious code, such as a computer virus, a keystroke logger, or "spyware"
into a program that has previously been released under a "free software" license
agreement.[fn13] The act of inserting malicious code into software, if done by a
private individual or company (though many governments will contend they are not
required to play by the same rules as the rest of us), may well violate criminal
laws and result in civil tort liability. It is, of course, also possible to deter
such malicious behavior by including, in a software license agreement, a specific
contractual term that prohibits such behavior meaning that any licensee who
violates the prohibition against malicious code can be sued by the licensor (or
by third-party beneficiaries who the licensor has explicitly identified as
alternate or additional enforcers of the agreement) for money damages and a court
order forbidding any continued violation.

  [fn13]In this regard, a the following hypothetical illustration should be
  particularly helpful. If an organization of computer security enthusiasts
  were to release, under the GNU General Public License ("GPL"), a program
  called "Grey Eminence 3000" ("GE3K") a remote-administration tool for
  Microsoft Windows, that helps illustrate how insecure this particular
  commercial product happens to be it should hardly be surprising that the
  United States Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation, after
  making some loud and misleading apocalyptic noises about "computer hackers"
  to Congress and in the media (primarily in a largely successful effort to
  increase their technology budgets), would also study the software to see what
  it does, how it does it, and whether any of those capabilities happen to be
  features that law enforcement might find helpful. Of course, if the U.S.
  federal law enforcement community were to announce, several months later,
  that it had commissioned the development of "classified" quasi-viral
  computer-intrusion and surveillance software called "Magic Candle" the
  capabilities of which law enforcement does not plan to disclose to the
  public, and the source code for which will remain a closely-guarded secret
  then inquiring minds might become curious as to whether "Magic Candle"
  contains any of the GPLed code that was written for "GE3K" (or any other free
  or open-source software, for that matter). Needless to say, under the right
  factual circumstances, if any GPLed code from GE3K found its way into "Magic
  Candle," then the U.S. government or its software development contractor
  might well be obligated to reveal to the public all the source code for
  "Magic Candle." Nevertheless, so long as the "Magic Candle" source is never
  publicly released for comparison purposes, then everyone with legitimate
  questions about GPL compliance faces a chicken-and-egg problem. So long as
  the source of "Magic Candle" remains secret, detection of a GPL violation
  becomes dramatically more difficult (particularly so if, additionally, nobody
  outside law enforcement has access to the compiled executables), which means
  the worldwide community of Internet users and software developers has only
  the United States government's solemn assurance that no GE3K code was used
  cold comfort at best.

Previous Licenses Provide More Limited Protection Against Government and Other
Surveillance: No software license agreement that qualifies as "free" or "open
source" may contain any restriction as a term of the license agreement that in
any way qualifies any Licensee's prerogative (no matter who they are or what
their motives may be) to make changes to code. In other words, an "open source"
license agreement, to qualify for the "open source" label, may not even contain a
term that prohibits the insertion of destructive viruses or "trojan horses" into
derivative code. Likewise, no "free" or "open source" license agreement can in
any way contain (as a license term) any restriction on the use of software not
even a prohibition against unlawful surveillance or other malicious uses of the
software.

The "open source" and "Free Software" communities rely principally on voluntary
compliance[fn14] with the disclosure provisions of license agreements (although
many "free" and "open source" license agreements, such as BSD-style licenses, do
not require changed code to be disclosed, and in fact enable modified versions of
programs to be "taken proprietary") and on social mechanisms of enforcement, as
means to detect, prevent, deter, and remedy abuses.

  [fn14]As the example in Note 13 illustrates, it is sometimes difficult to
  determine whether the source disclosure requirement of the GPL has been
  violated, such as when a modified version of a program has been distributed
  without source, precisely because detection of a disclosure violation depends
  in part on the disclosure of the source of derivative works in order to
  compare whether a putative derivative really does contain code derived from a
  GPLed parent work.

The Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement does not in any way
sacrifice or surrender the enforcement techniques and safeguards available under
license agreements such as the GNU General Public License. Rather, the HESSLA
enhances the options available to Hacktivismo and to qualified end-users, by
providing additional enforcement options. Moreover, for the purpose of promoting
the freedoms of both programers and end-users, through the enforced mandatory
disclosure of code modified by third-parties, this License Agreement has
advantages over many of the licenses (such as BSD-style licenses) that fully
qualify as "free" or "open-source" license agreements.

What makes this License Agreement an "enhanced source" License Agreement, instead
of a "free software" license agreement, is that the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source
Software License Agreement contains specific, very limited restrictions on
modification and use of software by Licensees, as part of a calculated trade-off
of rights and responsibilities that is intended to promote the freedom of
end-users.

The Enhanced-Source Bargain Reinforces End-User Freedoms: To protect Your rights,
we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny You specific rights or to
ask You to surrender these rights. To protect Your human rights as an end-user of
this program or any work based on it, we need to make restrictions that forbid
You and all other Licensees of this software (including, without limitation, any
government Licensees) from using this code to subvert the human rights of any
end-user.

We protect Your rights and the rights of all end-users with two steps: (1)
copyright the software, and (2) offer You this License Agreement which gives You
qualified legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

The restrictions shared by all Licensees translate into certain responsibilities
for You and for everyone else (including governmental entities everywhere) if You
distribute copies of the software, if You use it, or if You modify it.

In this regard, the methodology we employ is not materially different from the
methodology Free Software Foundation employs in the GNU General Public License
(the "GPL"). The methodology is to exchange the Author's permission to copy,
change, and/or distribute a copyrighted work, for every Licensee's acceptance of
terms and conditions that promote the licensor's objectives. In both this License
Agreement and the GPL, the terms and conditions that each Licensee must accept
are intended to discriminate against certain very narrow, limited kinds of human
endeavor, that are inconsistent with the licensor's political objectives. In
other words, the GPL requires each Licensee to promise not to engage in the
activity of 'propertizing,' or 'taking proprietary,' modifications to GPLed code;
modified code must also be released under the GPL, and cannot be released in the
form of "closed" executables, or otherwise be made "proprietary." Likewise, the
Hacktivismo Enhanced Source Software License Agreement discriminates against
undesirable activity such as surveillance, introduction of certain kinds of
malicious code, and human rights violations, as well as discriminating against
"propertizing" behavior such as might violate the GPL. Subject to these narrow
restrictions, Licensees under either license agreement enjoy very broad latitude
to change, use, explore, modify, and distribute the software much broader than
they would enjoy with typical "proprietary" software packages.

As with "copyleft" licenses such as the GPL, under the Hacktivismo Enhanced
Source Software License Agreement, programmers (including, most importantly,
programmers working for governments) do not have unfettered or completely
unlimited "freedom" for purposes of what they can do with HESSLA-licensed code.
Just as with the GPL, they do not have the "freedom" to convert HESSLA-licensed
code into "closed" or "proprietary" code. People who create derivative works
based on an HESSLA-licensed program and distribute those works have a
corresponding obligation to "give back," and not merely to "take,"
HESSLA-licensed code.

If You distribute copies of such an HESSLA-licensed program, whether gratis or
for a fee, You must give the recipients all the rights and responsibilities that
You have. You must ensure that they, too, are told of the terms of this License
Agreement, including the freedoms they have, and the kinds of uses and
modifications that are forbidden. You must communicate a copy of this License
Agreement to them as part of any copy, modification, or re-use of source or
object code, so they know their rights and responsibilities.

Thus, the main difference between this License Agreement and the GPL is not the
methodology we employ,[fn15] but the scope and breadth of the political
objectives we seek to promote. Simply put, the political objectives we promote
are somewhat broader than the explicit political goals that the Free Software
Foundation seeks to promote through the GPL. Our goals include a somewhat broader
range of human rights than the specific copyright-related rights with which the
GPL is principally concerned. But, while we are concerned with the entire field
of human rights rather than a subset, we want to make it perfectly clear that we
also embrace, share, and seek to promote, the goals we share with the Free
Software movement.

  [fn15] There is a modest difference, but it is not large, and mostly
  philosophical. Some experts on the GPL draw a distinction between a
  "contract" and a pure "license," by taking the position that a pure "license"
  does not impose "contractual" conditions on a Licensee only conditions that
  would otherwise (but for the license) be subsumed within with exclusive
  rights that the licensor has under copyright law. Thus, the licensor has the
  right to exclude anyone else from such activities as making copies, making
  derivative works, publicly performing a work, and other exclusive rights
  specified by statute. But, concerning the act of "using" a computer software
  program, in instances in which a copy is not made (or, in the trivial sense
  that a copy is made only temporarily from a storage medium to memory, to
  enable software to be "used"), the Free Software Foundation takes the
  position that United States law, at least, does not confer an exclusive right
  on the copyright holder (or, as others would argue, the United States statute
  qualifies the holder's exclusive right to copy),because the U.S. Copyright
  Act specifically exempts from the exclusive right to make copies, a copy made
  from (for example) a computer hard drive to volatile memory, in connection
  with the process of executing computer software. So far as we can determine,
  the Free Software Foundation does not argue that it is impossible
  "contractually" to impose conditions on use, as part of the bargain one
  strikes, when conditionally allowing Licensees to make copies of a program.
  Rather, for philosophical reasons, the Free Software Foundation voluntarily
  chooses not to include what it views as "contractual" conditions in the GPL.
  In this sense, Hactivismo takes the position that the HESSLA is clearly a
  "contract" and contains "contractual" terms, such that it should not be
  considered a "pure license," under the nomenclature employed by the Free
  Software Foundation. However, in our view, precisely because both the HESSLA
  and the GPL are clearly conditional grants of permission to do things from
  which the Licensee would otherwise be excluded (i.e., the Licensee must
  undertake certain obligations in exchange for permission to copy, modify, or
  distribute, a work), the key point is that the methodology is quite similar.

Compared with the GPL, aspects of the HESSLA give both end-users and programmers
(including, most importantly, governmental end-users and programmers) marginally
less leeway to make malicious use of the program, or to insert malicious code
into a program, than they would have under a traditional "copyleft" software
license. These aspects of the HESSLA (such as the requirement that the program
cannot be used to violate human rights, or forbidding the insertion of "spy-ware"
or surveillance mechanisms into derivative works) are included because our
ultimate objective is to preserve and promote the human rights of end-users,
including their privacy and their right of free expression.

In other words, unlike many programmers, we are not just in the business of
developing and distributing open-standards technologies. We're also trying to
empower end-users (including end-users in totalitarian regimes) with software
tools that promote fundamental freedoms while also seeking as best we can to
protect these end-users from being arrested, beaten, or worse. Our objective of
promoting end-user freedoms, including the freedoms of people in politically
repressive countries, is precisely the factor that has led Hacktivismo to develop
this License Agreement instead of using another.

The HESSLA Also Includes Features To Enhance Government Accountability: To this
end, we have sought and intend to ensure, to the fullest extent that law
(including, without limitation, the law of contract and of copyright licensing)
enables us to do so,[fn16] that no government or other institution may do
anything with this computer software or the underlying source code without
becoming a Licensee bound by the terms of this License Agreement, subject to the
same restrictions on modification and use as anyone else.

  [fn16] "Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent
  national tribunals for acts violating . . . fundamental rights . . ." Article
  8, United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

Accordingly, this License Agreement includes several terms that are aimed
explicitly at governmental entities, in order to maximize enforceability against
such entities. Respect for the Rule of Law means that no governmental entity is
above the law, and that no governmental entity should be permitted to use its
status as a mechanism for circumventing the requirements of this License
Agreement.

Any use, copying or modification of this software by any governmental official or
governmental entity anywhere in the world is a voluntary act, which act the
governmental official or entity is free to forego if it does not wish to be bound
by this License Agreement. This License Agreement seeks to establish as clearly
as possible two important checks on the improper use of government power. First,
the voluntary election to use, copy, or modify, this software by any government
or governmental official constitutes a waiver of all immunities that might
otherwise be asserted, against enforcement of this License Agreement by the
Author, or assertion by end-users or others of any human rights laws that may
have been violated by a government employing the Software. Second, any such
government or governmental official not only subjects itself to enforcement
action in its own courts, but also explicitly and voluntarily subjects itself to
enforcement action in the courts of other nations that are likely to be more
objective, for the purpose of giving effect to the terms of this License
Agreement.

Mechanism of Contract Acceptance: This License Agreement treats any use of the
software as acceptance of the terms of this License Agreement. To understand the
significance of this, it is important to distinguish between the law governing
copyright and the law governing offer and acceptance for the purpose of contract
formation (which gives the offeror the power to specify the manner of
acceptance). The question of whether copyright confers an exclusive right of use
on the author of a program is certainly an interesting one. Under United States
law, see 17 U.S.C. 117(a)(1), a limited exception to the exclusive right to copy
exists if one makes a second copy "created as an essential step in the
utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is
used in no other manner." This License Agreement presupposes that there is no
exclusive right to use in the Copyright Act, just an exclusive right to copy.
However, You may not make a copy for anyone else unless they are subject to the
terms of this License Agreement. Nor may You permit anyone to use Your copy or
any other copy You have made unless they are subject to the terms of this License
Agreement. You may not make a copy for Your own use or the use of anyone else
without the Author's leave to make that copy. And any use, modification, copying,
or distribution by anyone constitutes acceptance of the License Agreement, for
purposes of contract law. In other words, the License Agreement is designed so
that there is no loophole permitting anyone to claim the ability to use, copy,
distribute, or modify the Program or any Software based on it without subjecting
themselves voluntarily to its terms.

On "Shrinkwrap," "Click-Wrap," "Use-Wrap" and "Copy-Wrap" License Agreements:
Arguably, some kinds of software license agreements have more in common with
legislation than they do with the bargained-for, negotiated agreements that come
to mind when most people think of "contracts." Particularly if a software
licensor has sufficient market power to be deemed a monopoly, or if certain
proposed expansions of the law of software licensing, masquerading as
"codifications," are widely adopted, the ability of a private entity to impose
legal prohibitions and duties on virtually everyone else as though the licensor
has assumed powers that customarily belong to legislative bodies is both
breathtaking and deeply troubling. Of course, we are hardly the first to
distribute software under a license agreement that imposes conditions on a
take-it-or-leave-it basis. This technique is, as everyone knows, extremely common
with proprietary software. And some of the conditions unilaterally imposed by
proprietary licensors range from the ridiculous to the obscene. But even certain
kinds of "free" and "open-source" software licenses, such as the GPL, depend on
the continued viability of legal rules that enable at least some reasonable
conditions to be imposed by software licensors on a take-it-or-leave-it basis,
with essentially automated methods of acceptance. Courts have been divided as to
how far these kinds of licensor-driven automated agreements can go. And we cannot
say that we will be unhappy if courts or legislatures ultimately reach a
consensus that sharply limits what conditions licensors can impose through such
mechanisms. However, while the law is still developing, we think nothing could be
more appropriate than to enlist the techniques that institutions of power have
used to limit freedom and instead to re-purpose the techniques of "copy-wrap" or
"use-wrap" licensing by putting them to use for humanitarian purposes and using
them to promote the human rights of end-users. To deny us the use of these
techniques, courts and other law-making institutions would be required
simultaneously to disarm, to the same degree, proprietary software manufacturers
that possess vast market power. And, unlike the conditions imposed by many
proprietary vendors, the conditions we impose through this License Agreement are
hardly onerous for any end-user (unless, of course, the end-user wants to act
maliciously or engage in surveillance).

No Warranty: Next, for each author's protection and our own, we want to make
certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this software.
And, if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its
recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Software Patents: Software patents constantly threaten any project such as this
one. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a HESSLA-licensed program
will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have included terms by which any Author must, if
it has patented (or licensed a patent covering) any technology embodied in any
Program or Software released under this License Agreement, grant all HESSLA
Licensees of the Program or Software a royalty-free license of that technology.
Any Licensees who release derivative works, as permitted by this License
Agreement, are required to grant a royalty-free patent license of any patented
technology.

Anyone Can Release Original Software Under The HESSLA: Although this License
Agreement is drafted with Hacktivismo's objectives in mind, perhaps it will meet
other authors' needs as well. If You are considering using this License Agreement
for Your own software (meaning the code is not a work based on Hacktivismo's
program in which case all derivative works must be released under this License
Agreement but rather Your code is original software that You have developed
yourself) and if You have no special reason to prefer this License Agreement to
some license that has a more robust and widely-understood track-record, then in
most instances we encourage You to use the GPL (or, even better, release
concurrently under both the HESSLA and the GPL), because a considerable body of
interpretive literature and community custom has grown up around that License
Agreement. The Open Software License, see < http://www.rosenlaw.com/osl.html >,
is newer and has less of a track record. But You may also want to consider that
licensing option (as well as the option of concurrent OSL/HESSLA licensing).

Any author of original software can release that software under this License
Agreement, if You choose to do so; not just Hacktivismo. Hacktivismo is the
author and owner of software released by Hacktivismo under this License
Agreement. But original software released by other Authors would be owned and
licensed by them.

Ultimately, we think it is important to emphasize to other Authors that Programs
they have written can be released under both the HESSLA and some other license
simultaneously (for, example, a program that is presently GPLed by its Author can
be released simultaneously under both the GPL and the HESSLA, at the Author's
discretion). If You are an Author of original work, You need neither the
permission of the Free Software Foundation nor of Hacktivismo to elect to release
software simultaneously under both licenses. The advantage of such a voluntary
double-licensing is that it will enable developers to produce hybrid software
packages (combining the functionality available through, say, Hacktivismo's
Six-Four APIs, with some of the functionality of one or more popular GPL-licensed
communications programs) and to release the hybrid packages under the HESSLA,
without causing those developers to run afoul of the GPL, the HESSLA or both.
Such an arrangement maximizes the potential benefit to both the developer
community and to end-users worldwide. Software released under a BSD-style
license, as a general matter, can be used to produce a hybrid program, mixing
HESSLA-licensed code with code that was previously subject to a BSD license. The
HESSLA requires that, in such an instance, the hybrid code must be released under
the HESSLA (to avoid weakening the end-user protections and affirmative rights
afforded by the HESSLA). Hacktivismo is more than happy to consult with any
software developer about the license terms that should apply to any Software that
is derivative of any Program of which Hacktivismo is Author. If another Author
has released code under the HESSLA, then that Author has primary decision-making
authority about the manner in which his her or its software is licensed, but
Hacktivismo is happy to field any questions hat may be posed by such an Author or
by any developer who is building on another Author's HESSLAed code.

License Revisions: This License Agreement is subject to revision, prior to the
release of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement, Version
1.0. We invite interested parties from the international academic and legal
communities to offer comments and suggestions on ways to improve this License
Agreement, prior to the time that The HESSLA version 1.0 is released.

The terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement, up
to and including version 1.0, shall be deemed automatically to supersede the
terms of any lower-numbered version of this License Agreement with respect to any
Licensee who became a Licensee under the lower-numbered version of the HESSLA.

The terms of the latest and most up-to-date version of this License Agreement
will always be published on the Hacktivismo Website, http://www.hacktivismo.com/.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, use and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, USE AND/OR MODIFICATION

0. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined terms that, whenever used in this
License Agreement, have the following meanings:

0.1 Author: "Author" shall mean the copyright holder of an Original Work (the
"Program") released by the Author under this License Agreement.

0.2 Copy: "Copy" shall mean everything and anything that constitutes a copy
according to copyright law, without limitation. A "copy" does not become anything
other than a "copy" merely because, for example, a governmental or institutional
employee duplicates the Program or a part of it for another employee of the same
institution or Governmental Entity, or merely because it is copied from one
computer to another, or from one medium to another, or multiple copies are made
on the same medium, within the same institutional or Governmental Entity.

0.3 Derivative Work: A "Derivative Work" or "work based on the Program" shall
mean either the Program itself or any work containing the Program or a portion of
it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification."). In the unlikely event that, and to the extent that, this
contractual definition of "Derivative Work" is later determined by any tribunal
or dispute-resolution body to be different is scope from the meaning of
"derivative work" under the copyright law of any country, then the broadest and
most encompassing possible definition either the contractual definition of
"Derivative Work," or any broader and more encompassing statutory or legal
definition, shall control. Acceptance of this contractually-defined scope of the
term "Derivative Work" is a mandatory pre-condition for You to receive any of the
benefits offered by this License Agreement.

0.3.1 Mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program
(or with a Derivative Work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License
Agreement.

0.4 License Agreement: When used in this License Agreement, the terms "this
License" or "this License Agreement" shall mean The Hactivismo Enhanced-Source
Software License Agreement, v. 0.1, or any subsequent version made applicable
under the terms of Section 15.

0.5 Licensee: The term "Licensee" shall mean You or any other Licensee, whether
or not a Qualified Licensee.

0.6 Original Work: "Original Work" shall mean a Program or other work of
authorship, or portion thereof, that is not a Derivative Work.

0.7 Program: The "Program," to which this License Agreement applies, is the
Original Work (including, but not limited to, computer software) released by the
Author under this License Agreement.

0.8 Qualified Licensee: A "Qualified Licensee" means a Licensee that remains in
full compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You are
no longer a Qualified Licensee if, at any time, You violate any terms of this
License Agreement. Neither the Program nor any Software based on the Program may
be copied, distributed, performed, displayed, used or modified by You, even for
Your own purposes, unless You are a Qualified Licensee. A Licensee other than a
Qualified Licensee remains subject to all terms and conditions of this License
Agreement, and to all remedies for each cumulative violation as set forth herein.
Loss of the status of Qualified Licensee signifies that violation of any terms of
the License Agreement subjects a Licensee to loss of most of the benefits that
Qualified Licensees enjoy under this License Agreement, and to additional
remedies for all violations occurring after the first violation.

0.9 Software: "Software" or "the Software" shall mean the Program, any Derivative
Work based on the Program or a portion thereof, and/or any modified version of
the Program or portion thereof, without limitation.

0.10 Source Code: The term "Source Code" shall mean the preferred form of a
Program or Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to access and modify that Program or Original Work.

0.10.1 For an executable work, complete Source Code means all the Source Code for
all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However,
as a special exception, the Source Code distributed need not include anything
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

0.10.2 "Object Code:" Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control
rules, "object code" of the Program, or any modified version of the Program, or
Derivative Work based on the Program, must not be exported except by way of
distribution that is ancillary to the distribution of the Source Code. The
"Source Code" shall be understood as the primary content transferred or exported
by You, and the "object code" shall be considered as merely an ancillary
component of any such export distribution.

0.11 Strong Cryptography: "Strong Cryptography" shall mean cryptography no less
secure than (for example, and without limitation) a 2048-bit minimum key size for
RSA encryption, 1024-bit minimum key size for Diffie-Hellman (El Gamal), or a
256-bit minimum key size for AES and similar symmetric ciphers.

0.12 Substandard Key-Selection Technique: The term "Substandard Key-Selection
Technique" shall mean a method or technique to cause encryption keys to be more
easily guessed or less secure, such as by (i) causing the selection of keys to be
less than random, or (ii) employing a selection process that selects among only a
subset of possible keys, instead of from among the largest set of possible keys
that can securely be used consistent with contemporary knowledge about the
cryptographic techniques employed by You. The following illustrations elaborate
on the foregoing definition:

0.12.1 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption
algorithm You employ involves the selection of one or more prime numbers, or
involves one or more mathematical functions or concatenations performed on one or
more prime numbers, then each prime number should be selected from a very large
set of candidate prime numbers, but not necessarily from the set of all possible
prime numbers (e.g., inclusion of the number 1 in the candidate set, for example,
may in some instances reduce rather than enhance security), and absolutely not
from any artificially small set of candidate primes that makes the guessing of a
key easier than would be the case if a secure key-generation technique were
employed. In all instances, the primes should be selected at random from among
the candidate set. If there is a customary industry standard for maximizing the
security associated with the key-generation or key-selection technique for the
cryptosystem You select, then (with attention also to the requirements of Section
0.11), You should employ a key-generation or selection technique no less secure
than the customary industry standard for secure use of the cryptosystem.

0.12.2 If the key-generation or key-selection technique for the encryption
algorithm You employ involves the selection of a random integer, or the
transformation of a random integer through one or more mathematical processes,
then the selection of the integer shall be at random from the largest possible
set of all possible integers consistent with the secure functioning of the
encryption algorithm. It shall not be selected from an artificially small set of
integers (e.g., if a 256-bit random integer serves as the key, then You could not
set 200 of the 256 bits as "0," and randomly generate only the remaining 56 bits
producing effectively a 56-bit keylength instead of using the full 256 bits).

0.12.3 In other words, Your key-generation technique must promote security to the
maximum extent permitted by the cryptographic method(s) and keylength You elect
to employ, rather than facilitating eavesdropping or surveillance in any way. The
example of GSM telephones, in which 16 of 56 bits in each encryption key were set
at "0," thereby reducing the security of the system by a factor of 65,536, is
particularly salient. Such artificial techniques to reduce the security of a
cryptosystem by selecting keys from only a less-secure or suboptimal subset of
possible keys, is prohibited and will violate this License Agreement if any such
technique is employed in any Software.

0.13 You: Each Licensee (including, without limitation, Licensees that have
violated the License Agreement and who are no longer Qualified Licensees, but who
nevertheless remain subject to all requirements of this License Agreement and to
all cumulative remedies for each successive violation), is referred to as "You."

0.13.1 Governmental Entity: "You" explicitly includes any and all "Governmental
Entities," without limitation. "Governmental Entity" or "Governmental Entities,"
when used in this License Agreement, shall mean national governments,
sub-national governments (for example, and without limitation, provincial, state,
regional, local and municipal governments, autonomous governing units, special
districts, and other such entities), governmental subunits (without limitation,
governmental agencies, offices, departments, government corporations, and the
like), supra-national governmental entities such as the European Union, and
entities through which one or more governments perform governmental functions or
exercise governmental power in coordination, cooperation or unison.

0.13.2 Governmental Person: "You" also explicitly includes "Governmental
Persons." The terms "Governmental Person" or "Governmental Persons," when used in
this License Agreement, shall mean the officials, officers, employees,
representatives, contractors and agents of any Governmental Entity.

1. Application of License Agreement. This License Agreement applies to any
Program or other Original Work of authorship that contains a notice placed by the
Author saying it may be distributed under the terms of this License Agreement.
The preferred manner of placing such a notice is to include the following
statement immediately after the copyright notice for such an Original Work:

  "Licensed under the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement,
  Version 0.1"

2. Means of Acceptance Use, Copying, Distribution or Modification By Anyone
Constitutes Acceptance. Subject to Section 14.1 (concerning the special case of
certain Governmental Entities) any copying, modification, distribution, or use by
You of the Program or any Software, shall constitute Your acceptance of all terms
and conditions of this License Agreement.

2.1 As a Licensee, You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person to use the
Program or any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your
copy or copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License
Agreement and has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions.

2.2 You may not make any copy for Your own use unless You have accepted this
License Agreement and subjected yourself to all its terms and conditions.

2.3 You may not make a copy for the use of any other person, or transfer a copy
to any other person, unless such person is a Licensee that has accepted this
License Agreement and such person is subject to all terms and conditions of this
License Agreement.

2.4 It is not the position of Hacktivismo that copyright law confers an exclusive
right to use, as opposed to the exclusive right to copy the Software. However,
for purposes of contract law, any use of the Software shall be considered to
constitute acceptance of this License Agreement. Moreover, all copying is
prohibited unless the recipient of a copy has accepted the License Agreement.
Because each such recipient Licensee is contractually obligated not to permit
anyone to access, use, or secure a copy of the Software, without first accepting
the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, use by non-Licensees is
effectively prohibited contractually because nobody can obtain a copy of, or
access to a copy of, any Software without (1) accepting the License Agreement
through use, and (2) triggering some Licensee's obligation to require acceptance
as a precondition of copying or access.

3. "Qualified Licensee" Requirement: Neither the Program nor any Software or
Derivative Work based on the Program may be copied, distributed, displayed,
performed, used or modified by You, even for Your own purposes, unless You are a
"Qualified Licensee." To remain a Qualified Licensee, You must remain in full
compliance with all terms and conditions of this License Agreement.

4. License Agreement Is Exclusive Source of All Your Rights:

4.1 You may not copy, modify, or distribute the Program, or obtain any copy,
except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise
to copy, modify, obtain a copy, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and
will automatically terminate Your rights under this License Agreement and subject
You to all cumulative remedies for each successive violation that may be
available to the Author. However, Qualified Licensees who have received copies
from You (and thereby have received rights from the Author) under this License
Agreement, and who would otherwise qualify as Qualified Licensees, will not have
their rights under their License Agreements suspended or restricted on account of
anything You do, so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

4.2 You are not required to accept this License Agreement and prior to the time
You elect to become a Licensee and accept this License Agreement, You may always
elect instead not to copy, use, modify, distribute, compile, or perform the
Program or any Software released under this License Agreement. However, nothing
else grants You permission to copy, to obtain or possess a copy, to compile a
copy in object code or executable code from a copy in source code, to modify, or
to distribute the Program or any Software based on the Program. These actions are
prohibited by law if You do not accept this License Agreement. Additionally, as
set forth in Section 2, any use, copying or modification of the Software
constitutes acceptance of this License Agreement by You.

4.3 Each time You redistribute the Program (or any Software or Derivative Work
based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a License Agreement
from the Author to copy, distribute, modify, perform or display the Software,
subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement. You may not impose
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
License Agreement. Enforcement is the responsibility of the Author.

5. Grant of Source Code License.

5.1 Source Code Always Available from Author: Author hereby promises and agrees
except to the extent prohibited by export-control law to provide a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Program at the request of any
Licensee. Author reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the most current version of the
Program in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive
and convenient access by You for so long as Author continues to distribute the
Program, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice
immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Program. Every
copy of the Program distributed by Hacktivismo (but not necessarily every other
Author) consists of the Source Code accompanied, in some instances, by an
ancillary distribution of compiled Object Code, but the continued availability of
the Source Code from the Author addresses the possibility that You might have
(for any reason) not received from someone else a complete, current, copy of the
Source Code (lack of which would, for example, prevent You from exporting copies
to others without violating this license, see Section 8).

5.2 Grant of License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a Qualified
Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement, Author hereby
grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable copyright
license to do the following:

5.2.1 to reproduce the Source Code of the Program in copies;

5.2.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program and to edit or modify
the Source Code in the process of preparing such Derivative Works;

5.2.3 to distribute copies of the Source Code of the Original Work and/or of
Derivative Works to others, with the proviso that copies of Original Work or
Derivative Works that You distribute shall be licensed under this License
Agreement, and that You shall fully inform all recipients of the terms of this
License Agreement.

6. Grant of Copyright License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a
Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement,
Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable license to do the following:

6.1 to reproduce the Program in copies;

6.2 to prepare Derivative Works based upon the Program, or upon Software that
itself is based on the Program;

6.3 to distribute (either by distributing the Source Code, or by distributing
compiled Object Code, but any export of Object Code must be ancillary to a
distribution of Source Code) copies of the Program and Derivative Works to others,
with the proviso that copies of the Program or Derivative Works that You
distribute shall be licensed under this License Agreement, that You shall fully
inform all recipients of the terms of this License Agreement;

6.4 to perform the Program or a Derivative Work publicly;

6.5 to display the Program or a Derivative Work publicly; and

6.6 to charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy of the Program
(You may also, at Your option, offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee).

7. Grant of Patent License. If and only if, and for so long as You remain a
Qualified Licensee, in accordance with Section 3 of this License Agreement,
Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable license Agreement, under patent claims owned or controlled by
the Author that are embodied in the Program as furnished by the Author ("Licensed
Claims") to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Program. Subject to the
proviso that You grant all Licensees a world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
license under any patent claims embodied in any Derivative Work furnished by You,
Author hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
non-sublicensable license under the Licensed Claims to make, use, sell and offer
for sale Derivative Works.

8. Exclusions From License Agreement Grants. Nothing in this License Agreement
shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade
secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated
herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell
embodiments of any patent claims other than the Licensed Claims defined in
Section 7. No right is granted to the trademarks of Author even if such marks are
included in the Program. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be interpreted
to prohibit Author from licensing under additional or different terms from this
License Agreement any Original Work, Program, or Derivative Work that Author
otherwise would have a right to License.

8.1 Implied Endorsements Prohibited. Neither the name of the Author (in the case
of Programs and Original Works released by Hacktivismo, the name "Hacktivismo"),
nor the names of contributors who helped produce the Program may be used to
endorse or promote modifications of the Program, any Derivative Work, or any
Software other than the Program, without specific prior written permission of the
Author. Neither the name of Hacktivismo nor the names of any contributors who
helped write the Program may be used to endorse or promote any Program or
Software released under this License Agreement by any person other than
Hacktivismo.

9. Modifications and Derivative Works. Only Qualified Licensees may modify the
Software or prepare or distribute Derivative Works. If You are a Qualified
Licensee, Your authorization to modify the Software or prepare or distribute
Derivative Works (including permission to prepare and/or distribute Derivative
Works, as provided in Sections 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.6) is subject to
each and all of the following mandatory terms and conditions (9.1 through 9.6,
inclusive):

9.1 You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You
changed the files and the date of any change;

9.2 If the modified Software normally reads commands interactively when run, You
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that You provide a
warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under this License
Agreement, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License Agreement.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such
an announcement, Your Derivative Work based on the Program is not required to
print an announcement.);

9.3 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You,
that incorporates any portion of the Original Work, must not contain any code or
functionality that subverts the security of the Software or the end-user's
expectations of privacy, anonymity, confidentiality, authenticity, and trust,
including (without limitation) any code or functionality that introduces any
"backdoor," escrow mechanism, "spy-ware," or surveillance techniques or methods
into any such Program, Software, or modification thereof;

9.4 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You,
that employs any cryptographic or other security, privacy, confidentiality,
authenticity, and/or trust methods or techniques, including without limitation
any Derivative Work that includes any changes or modifications to any
cryptographic techniques in the Program, shall employ Strong Cryptography.

9.5 Any Program, Software, or modification thereof copied or distributed by You,
if it contains any key-generation or selection technique, must not employ any
Substandard Key-Selection Technique.

9.6 No Program or Software copied or distributed by You may transmit or
communicate any symmetric key, any "private key" if an asymmetric cryptosystem is
employed, or any part of such key, nor may it otherwise make any such key or part
of such key known, to any person other than the end-user who generated the key,
without the active consent and participation of that individual end-user. If a
private or symmetric key is stored or recorded in any manner, it must not be
stored or recorded in plaintext, and it must be protected from reading (at a
minimum) by use of a password. Use of steganography or other techniques to
disguise the fact that a private or symmetric key is even stored is strongly
encouraged, but not absolutely required.

10. Use Restrictions: Human Rights Violations Prohibited.

10.1 Neither the Program, nor any Software or Derivative Work based on the
Program may used by You for any of the following purposes (10.1.1 through 10.1.5,
inclusive):

10.1.1 to violate or infringe any human rights or to deprive any person of human
rights, including, without limitation, rights of privacy, security, collective
action, expression, political freedom, due process of law, and individual
conscience;

10.1.2 to gather evidence against any person to be used to deprive any person of
human rights;

10.1.3 any other use as a part of any project or activity to deprive any person
of human rights, including not only the above-listed rights, but also rights of
physical security, liberty from physical restraint or incarceration, freedom from
slavery, freedom from torture, freedom to take part in government, either
directly or through lawfully elected representatives, and/or freedom from
self-incrimination;

10.1.4 any surveillance, espionage, or monitoring of individuals, whether done by
a Governmental Entity, a Governmental Person, or by any non-governmental person
or entity;

10.1.5 censorship or "filtering" of any published information or expression.

10.2 Additionally, the Program, any modification of it, or any Software or
Derivative Work based on the Program may not be used by any Governmental Entity
or other institution that has any policy or practice (whether official or
unofficial) of violating the human rights of any persons.

10.3 You may not authorize, permit, or enable any person (including, without
limitation, any Governmental Entity or Governmental Person) to use the Program or
any Software or Derivative Work based on it (including any use of Your copy or
copies of the Program) unless such person has accepted this License Agreement and
has become a Licensee subject to all its terms and conditions, including (without
limitation) the use restrictions embodied in Section 10.1 and 10.2, inclusive.

11. All Export Distributions Must Consist of or Be Ancillary to Distribution of
Source Code. Because of certain peculiarities of current export-control law, any
distribution by You of the Program or any Software may be in the form of Source
Code only, or in the form or Source Code accompanied by compiled Object Code, but
You may not export any Software in the form of compiled Object Code only. Such an
export distribution of compiled executable code must in all cases be ancillary to
a distribution of the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed on a medium, or by a method, customarily used for software
interchange.

12. EXPORT LAWS: THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ADDS NO RESTRICTIONS TO THE EXPORT LAWS
OF YOUR JURISDICTION. It is Your responsibility to comply with any export
regulations applicable in Your jurisdiction. From the United States, Canada, or
many countries in Europe, export or transmission of this Software to certain
embargoed destinations (including, but not necessarily limited to, Cuba, Iran,
Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria), may be prohibited. If Hacktivismo is
identified as the Author of the Program (and it is not the property of some other
Author), then export to any national of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
Sudan or Syria, or into the territory of any of these countries, by any Licensee
who has received this Software directly from Hacktivismo or from the Cult of the
Dead Cow, or any of their members, is contractually prohibited and will
constitute a violation of this License Agreement. You are advised to consult the
current laws of any and all countries whose laws may apply to You, before
exporting this Software to any destination. Special care should be taken to avoid
export to any embargoed destination. An Author other than Hacktivismo may
substitute that Author's legal name for "Hacktivismo" in this Paragraph, in
relation to any Program released by that Author under this Paragraph.

13. Contrary Judgments, Settlements and Court Orders. If, as a consequence of a
court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on You (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License Agreement,
they do not excuse You from the conditions of this License Agreement. If You
cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously Your obligations under this
License Agreement and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence You
may not distribute the Software at all. For example, if a patent license would
not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through You, then the only way You could satisfy
both it and this License Agreement would be to refrain entirely from distribution
of the Program.

It is not the purpose of this Section 13 to induce You to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
Section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the software
distribution system reflected in this License Agreement, which is implemented by
public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the
wide range of software distributed through related distribution systems, in
reliance on consistent application of such distribution systems; it is up to the
Author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
other system and a Licensee cannot impose that choice.

14. Governmental Entities: Any Governmental Entity ("Governmental Entity" is
defined broadly as set forth in Section 0.13.1) or Governmental Person (as
"Governmental Person" is defined broadly in Section 0.13.2), that uses, modifies,
changes, copies, displays, performs, or distributes the Program, or any Software
or Derivative Work based on the Program, may do so if and only if all of the
following terms and conditions (14.1 through 14.10, inclusive) are agreed to and
fully met:

14.1 If it is the position of any Governmental Entity (or, in the case of any
"Governmental Person," if it is the position of that Governmental Person's
Governmental Entity) that any doctrine or doctrines of law (including, without
limitation, any doctrine(s) of immunity or any formalities of contract formation)
may render this License Agreement unenforceable or less than fully enforceable
against such Governmental Entity, or any Governmental Person of such Governmental
Entity, then prior to any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy
or distribution of the Program, or of any Software or Derivative Work based on
the Program, or any part thereof, by the Governmental Entity, or by any
Governmental Person of that Governmental Entity, the Governmental Entity shall be
required to inform the Author in writing of each such doctrine that is believed
to render this License Agreement or any part of it less than fully enforceable
against such Governmental Entity or any Governmental Person of such entity, and
to explain in reasonable detail what additional steps, if taken, would render the
License Agreement fully enforceable against such entity or person. Failure to
provide the required written notice to the Author in advance of any such use,
modification, change, display, performance, copy or distribution, shall
constitute an irrevocable and conclusive waiver of any and all reliance on any
doctrine, by the Governmental Entity, that is not included or that is omitted
from the required written notice (failure to provide any written notice means all
reliance on any doctrine is irrevocably waived). Any Governmental Entity that
provides written notice under this subsection is prohibited, as are all of the
Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity, from making any use, change,
display, performance, copy, modification or distribution of the Software or any
part thereof, until such time as a License Agreement is in place, agreed upon by
the Author and by the Governmental Entity, that such entity concedes is
fully-enforceable. Any use, modification, change, display, performance, copy, or
distribution following written notice under this Paragraph, but without the
implementation of an agreement as provided herein, shall constitute an
irrevocable and conclusive waiver by the Governmental Entity (and any and all
Governmental Persons of such Governmental Entity) of any and all reliance on any
legal doctrine either referenced in such written notice or omitted from it.

14.2 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, or
distributes, the Software or any part or portion thereof, or any Governmental
Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the
person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), permanently and
irrevocably waives any defense based on sovereign immunity, official immunity,
the Act of State Doctrine, or any other form of immunity, that might otherwise
apply as a defense to, or a bar against, any legal action based on the terms of
this License Agreement.

14.2.1 With respect to any enforcement action brought by the Author in a United
States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any
Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby
expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . .
. in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).
Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the
"commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), (3) are
also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or
any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S.
Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a
corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other
sovereign.

14.2.2 With respect to any enforcement action brought by an authorized end-user
(as a third-party beneficiary, under the terms of Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10)
in a United States court against a foreign Governmental Entity, the waiver by any
Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby
expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a "case . .
. in which the foreign state has waived its immunity," within the scope of 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended).
. Each such Governmental Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the
"commercial activity" exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2), (3) are
also applicable. With respect to an action brought against the United States or
any United States Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S.
Governmental Entity shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a
corresponding waiver of immunity from actions in the courts of any other
sovereign.

14.2.3 With respect to any action or effort by the Author in the United States to
execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by attaching or
executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity, the waiver by
any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2 is hereby
expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a case in
which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid of
execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(1) of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental
Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity"
exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With
respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States
Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity
shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of
immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.2.4 With respect to any action or effort brought by an authorized end-user (as
a third-party beneficiary, in accordance with Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10) in
the United States to execute a judgment against a foreign Governmental Entity, by
attaching or executing process against the property of such Governmental Entity,
the waiver by any Governmental Entity as provided in Subparagraphs 14.1 and 14.2
is hereby expressly acknowledged by each such Governmental Entity to constitute a
case in which "the foreign state has waived its immunity from attachment in aid
of execution or from execution," in accordance with 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(1) of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). Each such Governmental
Entity also specifically agrees and concedes that the "commercial activity"
exceptions to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1610(a)(2), (d) are also applicable. With
respect to an action brought against the United States or any United States
Governmental Entity, in the courts of any country, the U.S. Governmental Entity
shall be understood to have voluntarily agreed to a corresponding waiver of
immunity from actions in the courts of any other sovereign.

14.3 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays,
performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any Governmental
Person who does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the
person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), and thereby violates
any terms and conditions of Section 9 (restrictions on modification), or
Paragraph 10 (use restrictions), agrees that the person or entity is subject not
only to an action by the Author, for the enforcement of this License Agreement
and for money damages and injunctive relief (as well as attorneys' fees,
additional and statutory damages, and other remedies as provided by law), but
such Governmental Entity and/or Person also shall be subject to a suit for money
damages and injunctive relief by any person whose human rights have been violated
or infringed, in violation of this License Agreement, or through the use of any
Software in violation of this License Agreement. Any person who brings an action
under this section against any Governmental Person or Entity must notify the
Author promptly of the action and provide the Author the opportunity to intervene
to assert the Author's own rights. Damages in such a third-party action shall be
measured by the severity of the human rights violation and the copyright
infringement or License Agreement violation, combined, and not merely by
reference to the copyright infringement. All end-users, to the extent that they
are entitled to bring suit against such Governmental Entity by way of this
License Agreement, are intended third-party beneficiaries of this License
Agreement. Punitive damages may be awarded in such a third-party action against a
Governmental Entity or Governmental Person, and each and every such Governmental
Entity or Person conclusively waives all restrictions on the amount of punitive
damages, and all defenses to the award of punitive damages to the extend such
limitations or defenses depend upon or are a function of such person or entity's
status as a Governmental Person or Governmental Entity.

14.4 Any State of the United States, or any subunit or Governmental Entity
thereof, that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays, performs, or distributes
the Software of any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental Persons does so
(whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or
was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably waives for
purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement, (ii) to
remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of the
third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 -- any immunity under
the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution or any other immunity
doctrine (such as sovereign immunity or qualified, or other, official immunity)
that may apply to state governments, subunits, or to their Governmental Persons.

14.5 Any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, any State of the
United States), that uses, copies, changes, modifies, performs, displays, or
distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose Governmental
Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's
action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and irrevocably
waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License Agreement,
(ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to invoke any of
the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any doctrine (such
as, but not limited to, the holding in the United States Supreme Court decision
of Ex Parte Young) that might purport to limit remedies solely to prospective
injunctive relief. Also explicitly and irrevocably waived is any underlying
immunity doctrine that would require the recognition of such a limited exception
for purposes of remedies. The remedies against such governmental entities and
persons shall explicitly include money damages, additional damages, statutory
damages, consequential damages, exemplary damages, punitive damages, costs and
fees that might otherwise be barred or limited in amount on account of
governmental status.

14.6 Any Governmental Entity that uses, copies, changes, modifies, displays,
performs, or distributes the Software or any part thereof, or any of whose
Governmental Persons does so (whether that person's Governmental Entity contends
the person's action was, or was not, authorized or official), unconditionally and
irrevocably waives for purposes of any legal action (i) to enforce this License
Agreement, (ii) to remedy infringement of the Author's copyright, or (iii) to
invoke any of the third-party beneficiary rights set forth in Section 14.3 any
and all reliance on the Act of State doctrine, sovereign immunity, international
comity, or any other doctrine of immunity whether such doctrine is recognized in
that government's own courts, or in the courts of any other government or nation.

14.6.1 Consistent with Subparagraphs 14.2.1 through 14.2.4, this waiver shall
explicitly be understood to constitute a waiver not only against suit, but also
against execution against property, for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act of 1976 (as amended). All United States Governmental Entities
shall be understood to have agreed to a corresponding waiver of immunity against
(i) suit in the courts of other sovereigns, and (ii) execution against property
of the United States located within the territory of other countries.

14.7 Governmental Persons, (i) who violate this License Agreement (whether that
person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or was not,
authorized or official), or (ii) who are personally involved in any activity,
policy or practice of a governmental entity that violates this License Agreement
(whether that person's Governmental Entity contends the person's action was, or
was not, authorized or official), or (iii) that use, copy, change, modify,
perform, display or distribute, the Software or any part thereof, when their
Governmental Entity is not permitted to do so, or is not a Qualified Licensee, or
has violated the terms of this License Agreement, each and all individually waive
and shall not be permitted to assert any defense of official immunity, "good
faith" immunity, qualified immunity, absolute immunity, or other immunity based
on his or her governmental status.

14.8 No Governmental Entity, nor any Governmental Person thereof may, by
legislative, regulatory, or other action, exempt such Governmental Entity,
subunit, or person, from the terms of this License Agreement, if the Governmental
Entity or any such person has voluntarily used, modified, copied, displayed,
performed, or distributed the Software or any part thereof.

14.9 Enforcement In Courts of Other Sovereigns Permitted. By using, modifying,
changing, displaying, performing or distributing any Software covered by this
License Agreement, any Governmental Entity hereby voluntarily and irrevocably
consents, for purposes of (i) any action to enforce the terms of this License
Agreement, and (ii) any action to enforce the Author's copyright (whether such
suit be for injunctive relief, damages, or both) to the jurisdiction of any court
or tribunal in any other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a
subunit, province, or state of such country) in which the terms of this License
Agreement are believed by the Author to be enforceable. Each such Governmental
Entity hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all objections
based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of forum non
conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental status or
immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other sovereign.

14.9.1 The Waiver by any Governmental Entity of a country other than the United
States shall be understood explicitly to constitute a waiver for purposes of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (see Subparagraphs 14.2.1to 14.2.4,
inclusive, supra), and all United States Governmental Entities shall be
understood to have agreed to a waive correspondingly broad in scope with respect
to actions brought in the courts of other sovereigns.

14.9.2 Forum Selection Non-U.S. Governmental Entities. Governmental Entities that
are not United States Governmental Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree
to be subject to suit, in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring an action in another
court in another country, but the United States District Court for the District
of Columbia, shall always be available as an agreed-upon forum for such an
action. At the optional election of any Author (or, in the case of a third-party
claim, any end-user asserting rights under Subparagraphs 14.3 and 14.10), such a
suit against a non-U.S. Governmental Entity or Person may be brought in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, or the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, as a direct
substitute for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for
all purposes of this Subparagraph.

14.9.3 Forum Selection U.S. Governmental Entities. All United States Governmental
Entities shall be subject to suit, and agree to be subject to suit, in the
following (non-exclusive) list of fora: Ottawa, Canada, London, England, and
Paris, France. The Author or an authorized end-user may bring action in another
court that can exercise jurisdiction. But the courts in these three locations
shall always be available (at the option of the Author or an authorized end-user)
as a forum for resolving any dispute with the United States or a governmental
subunit thereof. Except as provided in Subparagraph 14.10, any and all United
States Governmental Persons shall be subject to suit wherever applicable rules of
personal jurisdiction and venue shall permit such suit to be filed, but no such
United States Governmental Person may assert any defense based on forum non
conveniens or international comity, to the selection of any particular lawful
venue.

14.10 Enforcement Of Claims For Human Rights Violations. By using, copying,
modifying, changing, performing, displaying or distributing the Software covered
by this License Agreement, any Governmental Entity, or Governmental Person hereby
voluntarily and irrevocably consents -- for purposes of any third-party action to
remedy human rights violations and other violations of this License Agreement (as
reflected in Section 14.3) -- to the jurisdiction of any court or tribunal in any
other country (or a court of competent jurisdiction of a subunit, province, or
state of such country) in which the third-party beneficiary reasonably believes
the relevant terms of this License Agreement are enforceable. The Governmental
Entity or Person hereby waives all objections to personal jurisdiction, all
objections based on international comity, all objections based on the doctrine of
forum non conveniens, and all objections based on sovereign or governmental
status or immunity that might otherwise be asserted in the courts of some other
sovereign.

14.10.1 Waiver of Immunity and Forum Selection. The presumptively valid and
preferred fora identified in Subparagraphs 14.9.2 and 14.9.3 shall also apply for
purposes of Subparagraph 14.10. All Governmental Entities are subject to the same
Waiver of Immunity as set forth in Subparagraphs 14.2.1 to 14.2.4, inclusive.

15. Subsequent Versions of HESSLA. Hacktivismo may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software License Agreement from time
to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. Any Program released by
Hacktivismo under a version of this License Agreement prior to Version 1.0, shall
be considered released under Version 1.0 of the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source
Software License Agreement, once Version 1.0 is formally released. Prior to
Version 1.0, any Software released by Hacktivismo or a Licensee of Hacktivismo
under a lower-numbered version of the HESSLA shall be considered automatically to
be subject to a higher-number version of the HESSLA, whenever a later-numbered
version has been released.

Concerning the work of any other Author, if the Program specifies a version
number of this License Agreement which applies to it and "any later version," You
have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or
of any later version published by Hacktivismo. If the Program does not specify a
version number of this License Agreement, You may choose any version after 1.0,
once version 1.0 is published by Hacktivismo, and prior to publication of version
1.0, You may choose any version of the Hacktivismo Software License Agreement
then published by Hacktivismo. If the Program released by another Author,
specifies only a version number, then that version number only shall apply. If
"the latest version," is specified, then the latest version of the HESSLA
published on the Hacktivismo Website shall always apply at all times.

16. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS
IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT AND WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL
WORK IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
WITH ALL FAULTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO LICENSE TO ORIGINAL WORK IS GRANTED HEREUNDER
EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING THE AUTHOR'S NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER ARISING AS A RESULT OF THIS LICENSE OR
THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PERSON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO
THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION, BUT SHALL EXCLUDE SUCH
LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

18. ENCRYPTION KEYS AND PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE. SOFTWARE RELEASED UNDER THIS
LICENSE AGREEMENT MAY REQUIRE A DIGITAL CERTIFICATE, OR AN ENCRYPTION KEY
"SIGNED" BY A TRUSTED PARTY, TO FUNCTION. AUTHOR UNDERTAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR
THE PROPER, SECURE, AND ADEQUATE FUNCTIONING OF ANY CRYPTOGRAPHIC SYSTEMS, OF ANY
CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, OR FOR THE TRUSTWORTHINESS OF ANY END-USER, ANY ISSUER OF
CERTIFICATES, OR OF ANY SIGNER OF ENCRYPTION KEYS. USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS AT THE
END-USER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RISK. IN ANY PUBLIC-KEY INFRASTRUCTURE ("PKI")
SYSTEM, AN END-USER'S LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE END-USER'S CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY DOES NOT INCLUDE OR ENCOMPASS ANY LEGAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AUTHOR,
AND IS GOVERNED SOLELY AND EXCLUSIVELY BY THE CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY'S
CERTIFICATION PRACTICE STATEMENT AND CERTIFICATION AGREEMENTS. AUTHOR ASSUMES NO
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY END-USER OR ANY CERTIFICATION
AUTHORITY.

18. Saving Clause. If any portion of this License Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the License
Agreement is intended to apply and the License Agreement as a whole is intended
to apply in other circumstances.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------


  2.1. Grants

  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license:

    a. 

      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger
      Work; and

    b. 

      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
      Contributor Version.


  2.2. Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
  such Contribution.


  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    a. 

      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b. 

      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

    c. 

      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
      Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
  requirements in Section 3.4).


  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
  terms of Section 3.3).


  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
  Contributions conveyed by this License.


  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
  Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities
-------------------


  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.


  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    a. 

      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b. 

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.


Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,
  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can
  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.


Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
---------------------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined
  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

    copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 Python Software
    Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained in Python alone or in any
    derivative version prepared by Licensee.

  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
    incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative
    work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to
    include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.

  4.  PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. PSF MAKES
    NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT
    NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF
    PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

  5.  PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON FOR ANY
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
    MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
    THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

  6.  This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach
    of its terms and conditions.

  7.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
    relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
    Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
    trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products
    or services of Licensee, or any third party.
